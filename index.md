## Introduction

Over the years a lot of good methods for low-light image enhancement have been developed. The methods to do so thus actually exist and often consist of some sort of deep learning architecture [SOURCE] but there one main problem with this type of architures namely their high computational costs which on itself leads a slow way of operating these methods. This make most of the existing methods for low-light image enhancement non-practical solutions. In the paper "Restoring Extremely Dark Images in Real-Time" (M. Lamba & K. Mitra, 2021) a fast and memory efficient solution is presented which at the same time produces proper quality (light enhanced) images. 
In this blog post we will put the robostness of their model to the test by focussing on the models -- brede accepetatie? -- when it comes to the pre-processing phase. The way in which we will be testig this can be summarized as...

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/chrisy781/chrisy781.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/chrisy781/chrisy781.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
